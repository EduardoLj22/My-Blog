# My-Blog
In this activity, I created a personal blog application that enables users to submit and view blog posts. The application consists of a landing page with a submission form and a posts page to display the entries.

*Key Features:*
- *Landing Page:* Includes a form with inputs for username, blog title, and content. It validates input, shows error messages if fields are empty, stores data in localStorage, and redirects to the posts page upon successful submission.
- *Posts Page:* Displays a list of blog posts from localStorage, showing the title, content, and author. Features a light/dark mode toggle and a "Back" button to return to the landing page.
- *File Structure:* Organized into separate directories for CSS and JavaScript files, ensuring clean and manageable code.

This project meets all acceptance criteria and provides a functional, user-friendly blog application, enhancing my front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
